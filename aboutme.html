            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Hoang, an Embedded Systems student with a passion for cybersecurity, networking, and programming. 
                I’m constantly expanding my knowledge and skills by doing some cool little projects on my own. 
                I’m currently working on various tech projects, namely my small home server to work on my Networking and
                Linux skills. 
            </p>

            <h2>What you will find here</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to build a platform where I can put my portfolio on display even though not big and extensive. It's a combination
                of a resume of sorts, as well as giving a bit more insight to me as a person, my interests and some geeky projects
                I'm working on. 
            </p>

            <div class="interests">
                <h2>Skills and Interests</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="tech-icon">🧑‍💻</span> Software Development</li>
                    <li><span class="tech-icon">🔐</span> Cybersecurity</li>
                    <li><span class="tech-icon">🌐</span> Networking</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>The One Step Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    Something you probably have seen on my homepage already: The One Step Rule. Heavily inspired by this video
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Vp-TVkqaCrQ?si=Smt3dOBqOUYQ2Qhk " target="_blank"><span class="tech-icon">🔗</span> here</a>. 
                    Since watching this I cannot stop thinking about progressing each day, no matter how much progress. Everyday
                    I take one step in hope of progressing further in my life and it doesn't matter how big the step is. As long as 
                    you take one, you're on the right track.
