            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                <h2>Technical Stuff</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Hoang, an Embedded Systems student with a passion for cybersecurity, networking, and programming. 
                        I‚Äôm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills by doing some cool little projects on my own. 
                        Currently, I‚Äôm working on various tech projects, namely my small home server to work on my Networking and
                        Linux skills. 
                    </p>

                <h2> Other Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from those technical things I'm a big Gamer, I play guitar and I love everything related to racing. 
                    In terms of music, I produced some electronic music for a while but I haven't been doing anything lately. 
                    I'm absolutely a metal person but I play things across the board, from Pop to Jazz. Lastly, motorsports. 
                    I love racing, particularly the prototype class in the WEC üèéÔ∏è. 
                    Often times I just jump into my sim racing setup and go for a few laps around my favourite tracks to kill time.
                </p>

            <h1>What you will find here</h1>
            <p>
                I wanted to build a platform where I can put my portfolio on display even though not big and extensive. It's a combination
                of a resume of sorts, as well as giving a bit more insight to me as a person, my interests, hobbies and some geeky projects
                I'm working on. 
            </p>

                <h2>The One Step Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    Something you probably have seen on my homepage already: <b><i>The One Step Rule</i></b>. Heavily inspired by this video
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Vp-TVkqaCrQ?si=Smt3dOBqOUYQ2Qhk " target="_blank"><span class="tech-icon"></span> here üîó</a>. 
                    Since watching this I cannot stop thinking about progressing each day, no matter how much progress. Everyday
                    I take one step in hope of progressing further in my life and it doesn't matter how big the step is. As long as 
                    you take one, you're on the right track.
