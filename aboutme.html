            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Hoang, an Embedded Systems student with a passion for cybersecurity, networking, and programming. 
                I’m constantly expanding my knowledge and skills by doing some cool little projects on my own. 
                I’m currently working on various tech projects, namely my small home server to work on my Networking and
                Linux skills. 
            </p>

            <h1>What you will find here</h1>
            <p>
                I wanted to build a platform where I can put my portfolio, even though not big and extensive. It's a combination
                of a resume of sorts, as well as giving a bit more insight to me as a person, my interests and some geeky projects
                I'm working on. 
            </p>
