            <h2>Raspberry Pi 5 Home Server</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                Ignoring the currently (still) high prices, the Raspberry Pi 5 is a super powerful PC, even though
                it has the size of a credit card. Whether you use it as a desktop PC, a gaming console, or like me, a
                home server, you'll find so many amazing use cases. Here I will showcase some things I have done and show 
                you one or the other setup. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project covers the setup of a Raspberry Pi 5 as a small home server, including installation of services 
                    like web servers, monitoring tools and Docker. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What you'll need:</b>
                    <ul class="shifted-list">
                        <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
                        <li>MicroSD card (at least 32GB or Nvme SSD)</li>
                        <li>Power supply</li>
                        <li>Internet connection (Ethernet or WiFi)</li>
                        <li>(Optional) Keyboard and mouse</li>
                        <li>(Optional) HDMI cable for monitor connection</li>
                        <li>(Optional) Raspberry Pi 5 Case</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    My configuration includes the <a href="https://www.rasppishop.de/Argon-ONE-V3-M2-NVME-PCIE-Gehaeuse"> Argon ONE V3 NVME Case</a> and a 256GB NVMe 
                    SSD, which was repurposed from my laptop after an upgrade. This case offers a built-in an for thermal management and an NVMe SSD adapter. While the 
                    adapter adds to the cost, an SSD is in all ways superior to a MicroSD, especially when you consider setting up something like a remote file system.
                    <br>
                    This thing with my power supply is pretty much the hardware setup. The rest is configuration on the Pi itself. Don't worry, pretty much all of the 
                    services I installed have a GUI to them, making it super easy to configure things, without living in the terminal emulator.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Initial Setup</b>
                    <br>
                    1. Install your operating system. I recommend booting from an SSD for better performance. You can set this up using a bootable USB or MicroSD card
                    <br>
                    2. My OS of choice is Linux Server, which operates entirely via the console (no desktop environment), but is not needed, just more lightweight
                    <br>
                    3. Configure SSH (Secure Shell) to enable remote access to your Raspberry Pi (you can look that up)
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Networking Basics</b>
                    <br>
                    Some things you need to know:
                    <ul class="shifted-list">
                        <li>Your router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1) serves as a gateway to your network settings</li>
                        <li>Tools like Fing (a mobile app) can scan your network and list connected devices. Alternatively, access your router’s GUI through a browser for similar information</li>
                        <li>Some routers, like mine, even offer features such as WireGuard VPN, eliminating the need to set up VPN services on the Raspberry Pi</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    What you basically need to know is the addressing scheme of your private network. Because all the other devices will have the same address space, 
                    just a different number at the end to uniquely identify your devices. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What I installed</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul class="shifted-list">
                        <li>Monitoring: RPI Monitor, Grafana + Prometheus</li>
                        <li>Docker Management: Portainer</li>
                        <li>File Sharing/Cloud: NextCloud</li>
                        <li>Distributed Computing: folding@home</li>
                        <li>News Aggregator: TTRSS (Tiny Tiny RSS)</li>
                        <li>Dashboard: Homarr</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Most of the applications in this list are deployed as Docker containers, which is a super easy way to install applications but also to manage them. Management works
                    either with Portainer, a GUI for your Docker containers, or simply by using the terminal. I end up using both, depending on what is just more comfortable for me at the moment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Installation Process</b>
                    <br>
                    In order to start installing things, it is always good practice to update your pi with:
                    
                    <pre><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>
                    
                    You can also just use the two commands one after another. The -y flag automatically says yes for you, since apt upgrade should always ask you whether you want to install the 
                    upgrades or not. This should take some time but afterwards you're ready to go. 
                    <br>
                    When I started out, I firstly installed RPI Monitor.

            <h2>Kubernetes with Raspberry Pi?!</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                This project builds on the RPI5 home server project by adding some spicy hardware. A Raspberry Pi 4, 
                and four, yes four Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. Everything fitted neatly into a cluster case. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project demonstrates how to set up a Raspberry Pi cluster using Kubernetes. The goal is to turn the 
                    cluster into a high-performance computing system that can run containerized applications. It explores the 
                    challenges of managing multiple Raspberry Pi units and how Kubernetes can help.

            <h2>Switching to Arch Linux + KDE Plasma/Hyprland</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                After having used Windows, MacOS, and Linux Mint, it's time for Arch Linux. Although quite an impulsive decision, it has probably been my best choice so far. I'll guide you 
                through the process from the perspective of a Linux beginner.
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>
                    To start things off, I did a manual install—no ArchInstaller. I had previously used dual boot with Windows 11 and Linux Mint but ended up completely wiping my SSD after 
                    making a mistake. I started fresh from scratch. Your best friend when working with Arch Linux will be the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">Arch Wiki</a>. 
                    It's super easy to follow and contains pretty much everything you'll need on your journey. 
                    <br><br>
                    When I installed Arch, I decided to dual-boot with Linux Mint. This was mostly because I was worried Arch would be too complicated for a beginner like me, or that I might 
                    mess something up and lose all my data. <strong>Always back up your data</strong>. Fortunately, it wasn't as difficult as I thought, thanks to all the resources available online. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>How did I start?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I followed the installation wiki, but to summarize: First, I created a bootable USB with the Arch ISO and booted from it. Then, I created partitions for root and EFI (for UEFI boot), 
                    formatted them accordingly, set up the network, and finally chrooted into the filesystem. After this, all I needed was a GUI. 
                    <br>
                    I started with SDDM and KDE Plasma, but later discovered Tiling with Hyprland, which is now my absolute favorite. The difference between a tiling window manager and a traditional 
                    floating window system (like in Windows) is that, in a tiling manager, application windows are arranged as tiles. You can resize the tiles, but they cannot overlap. A lot of navigation happens via keyboard shortcuts, which makes you feel like a true "hackerman."
