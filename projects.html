            <h2>Raspberry Pi 5 Home Server</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                Ignoring the currently (still) high prices, the Raspberry Pi 5 is a super powerful PC, even though
                it has the size of a credit card. Whether you use it as a desktop PC, a gaming console, or like me, a
                home server, you'll find so many amazing use cases. Here I will showcase some things I have done and show 
                you one or the other setup. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project covers the setup of a Raspberry Pi 5 as a small home server, including installation of services 
                    like web servers, monitoring tools and Docker. 
                    <br>
                    Down below are some things you'll need:
                    <ul class="shifted-list">
                        <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
                        <li>MicroSD card (at least 32GB or Nvme SSD)</li>
                        <li>Power supply</li>
                        <li>Internet connection (Ethernet or WiFi)</li>
                        <li>Keyboard and mouse (optional)</li>
                        <li>HDMI cable for monitor connection (optional)</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Kubernetes with Raspberry Pi?!</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                This project builds on the RPI5 home server project by adding some spicy hardware. A Raspberry Pi 4, 
                and four, yes four Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. Everything fitted neatly into a cluster case. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project demonstrates how to set up a Raspberry Pi cluster using Kubernetes. The goal is to turn the 
                    cluster into a high-performance computing system that can run containerized applications. It explores the 
                    challenges of managing multiple Raspberry Pi units and how Kubernetes can help.
