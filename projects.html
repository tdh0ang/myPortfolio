            <h2>Raspberry Pi 5 Home Server</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                Ignoring the currently (still) high prices, the Raspberry Pi 5 is a super powerful PC, even though
                it has the size of a credit card. Whether you use it as a desktop PC, a gaming console, or like me, a
                home server, you'll find so many amazing use cases. Here I will showcase some things I have done and show 
                you one or the other setup. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project covers the setup of a Raspberry Pi 5 as a small home server, including installation of services 
                    like web servers, monitoring tools and Docker. 
                    <br>
                    Down below are some things you'll need:
                    <ul class="shifted-list">
                        <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
                        <li>MicroSD card (at least 32GB or Nvme SSD)</li>
                        <li>Power supply</li>
                        <li>Internet connection (Ethernet or WiFi)</li>
                        <li>Keyboard and mouse (optional)</li>
                        <li>HDMI cable for monitor connection (optional)</li>
                        <li>Raspberry Pi 5 Case (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    My setup in case you want to know consists of my Pi, an <a href="https://www.rasppishop.de/Argon-ONE-V3-M2-NVME-PCIE-Gehaeuse"> Argon ONE V3 NVME Case</a>
                    a 256GB Nvme SSD that I have from my laptop because I upgraded my laptop SSD, so I had a spare lying around. This thing with my 
                    power supply is pretty much the hardware setup. The rest is configuration on the Pi itself. Don't worry, pretty much all of the 
                    services I installed have a GUI to them, making it super easy to configure things, without living in the terminal emulator. Another
                    thing I wanted to mention is, that the case has a built-in fan and Nvme SSD adapter, the adapter being a more expensive option. So you 
                    also have thermal control, in case your Pi runs too hot. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What now?</b>
                    <br>
                    So for this I'm going to assume that you have everything installed. Booting from SSD might be something you need to look up. The installation process 
                    is pretty simple and you can do it with a bootable USB or MicroSD.

            <h2>Kubernetes with Raspberry Pi?!</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                This project builds on the RPI5 home server project by adding some spicy hardware. A Raspberry Pi 4, 
                and four, yes four Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. Everything fitted neatly into a cluster case. 
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>This project demonstrates how to set up a Raspberry Pi cluster using Kubernetes. The goal is to turn the 
                    cluster into a high-performance computing system that can run containerized applications. It explores the 
                    challenges of managing multiple Raspberry Pi units and how Kubernetes can help.

            <h2>Switching to Arch Linux + KDE Plasma/Hyprland</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                After having used Windows, MacOS and Linux Mint, its time for Arch Linux. Quite an impulsive decision, but so far
                it is probably my best decision so far. I'll guide you through some things here from a perspective of a Linux beginner.
            </p>
            <div class="full-description">
                <p>
                    To start things off, I did the manual install. So no ArchInstaller. I used dual boot Windows 11 and Linux Mint before,
                    but ended up completely wiping the SSD because I messed up something. So I started completely from scratch essentially.
                    Your best friend with Arch Linux is going to be the Arch Wiki: 
                    <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page"></a> . Super easy to 
                    follow and also has pretty much anything you'll ever need in your journey. 
                    <br>
                    When I installed it, I still decided to dual boot, but with Mint. Basically because I was worried that Arch would be too 
                    hard for a beginner like me, or that I would mess up something and lose all my data. <b> Always back up your data </b>. 
                    It ended up not being too much of a problem because of all the resources out there. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b> How did I start now? </b>
                    <br>
                    Just follow the installation wiki. But to sum it up: Create boot USB with Arch ISO and boot via USB, create partition, root 
                    and efi for UEFI boot and format them accordingly. Then set up your network and download some stuff and finally chroot into your 
                    filesystem. At this point you just need a GUI and you're pretty much done. 
                    <br>
                    In terms of GUI I started using SDDM with KDE Plasma to start things off. Then I discovered Tiling (with Hyprland). And its my absolute favourite 
                    right now. Theres also a description on the wiki, but basically we have something like Windows, where your application windows 
                    are floating. You can pull them around and they can be on top of each other and all that typical stuff. What Tiling is, is that 
                    you don't have this anymore. Each window is a tile on your display. You can resize, but you cannot overlap those, like you can with 
                    Windows. A lot of stuff ends up being keyboard shortcuts and you'll definitiely start feeling like a hackerman.
